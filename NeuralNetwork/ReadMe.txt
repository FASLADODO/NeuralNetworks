The Code solves two problem:
1) A toy star problem.
2) The goal is to be able to classify each minute of sleep, by utilizing the information on a set of EEG descriptors
(Alpha, Beta, Delta, Sigma, Theta, Artifact, REM 1 and REM2 counts per minute) that are automatically
detected from the EEG. Therefore, sleep stages are your desired targets, and these descriptors are your
inputs.
