The source code is for classification of Gorman and Sejnowski Sonar Dataset.It analysis of training the multi-layer perceptron
for Gorman and Sejnowski Sonar Dataset. A single hidden layer network with varied processing elements is compared with single 
layer perceptron for classification accuracy for train and test dataset using the confusion matrix.. This document also explores
the nature of the dataset and how it should be arranged for better training of the network. It discusses how the parameters of the
neural network like the learning rate, momentum, batch size and stopping criterion are varied and their impact on accuracy of the 
classification. We also present the initial and final weights and biases for the best trained network configuration for both single
layer perceptron as well as single hidden layer network.The repository contains the detailed report for analysis of different training
techniques and methods applied with the results.
